[Py]thon [M]ultiple-[R]epository
==========

PyMR is a python command-line tool used to execute arbitrary commands on a set of tagged directories.

## Features

* Configuration is stored in the registered directory (allows for version-controlled configuration)
* Any arbitrary command can be run, no ties to version-control specific commands.
* Simple! PyMR is currently less than 150 lines of Python.

## Where is PyMR

PyMR source is available on [Github](https://github.com/kpurdon/pymr) and is released to [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymr). I do plan on releasing PyMR as a [conda](http://www.continuum.io/blog/conda) package in the future.

Why I Created PyMR
----------

I created PyMR because I was not satisfied with other tools:

### [MR (myrepos)](http://myrepos.branchable.com/)

### [GR (git-run)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/git-run)
